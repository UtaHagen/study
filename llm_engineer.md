# 🧠 LLM Systems Engineer – Level-Up Checklist

A curated roadmap for leveling from **mid/senior LLM workflow builder** to **Staff-level LLM Systems Engineer**.  
Includes reliability, observability, evaluation, orchestration, and production-readiness best practices.

---

## ✅ 1. Evaluation & Observability

- [ ] Log prompts, responses, and token usage per LLM call
- [ ] Use `mlflow`, `LangSmith`, or custom logging to store traces and artifacts
- [ ] Track latency, retries, and model version across runs
- [ ] Implement trace IDs to group runs for session-level observability
- [ ] Add automated output evaluation (golden tests or LLM-as-a-judge)

---

## ⚙️ 2. Workflow Design & Orchestration

- [ ] Modularize workflows into clearly defined steps (tool → model → post-process)
- [ ] Use `asyncio`, `LangGraph`, or `CrewAI` for multi-hop flows
- [ ] Add fallback logic for model/tool failures (e.g., GPT-4 → GPT-3.5)
- [ ] Track retry reason, tool failures, and fallback path chosen
- [ ] Build long-term memory support (e.g., Redis, vector memory)

---

## 🧪 3. Testing & Prompt Versioning

- [ ] Store prompt versions with metadata (purpose, format, model compatibility)
- [ ] Create a test harness for workflows (unit + integration with mock LLMs)
- [ ] Add schema validation with `Pydantic` (✅ already using this!)
- [ ] Maintain a golden test set for scoring prompt output quality
- [ ] Compare new vs. old prompts using cosine sim / fuzzy match / eval score

---

## 🔐 4. Production Readiness

- [ ] Enforce API rate limits and backoff/retry behavior
- [ ] Handle timeouts, null responses, and malformed outputs gracefully
- [ ] Add role-based auth if exposing LLM endpoints to users
- [ ] Integrate structured logging with observability tools (Datadog, OpenTelemetry, etc.)
- [ ] Track total token cost per run

---

## 🛠️ 5. Cost Awareness & Scaling

- [ ] Simulate 10× task load to test concurrency, failure rates, and costs
- [ ] Identify which tasks can run in batch vs async
- [ ] Build a simple cost dashboard (tokens per model, per task type)
- [ ] Automatically downgrade to cheaper models if task allows

---

## 🧪 Bonus Build Projects

- [ ] ✅ LLM Pipeline Tracker → logs runs, tracks token usage, duration, outputs (via MLflow or LangSmith)
- [ ] 🧠 Self-Evaluating Agent → prompts → scores → logs → adapts
- [ ] ⚙️ LLM Orchestrator Class → handles tools, retries, logging, outputs
- [ ] 📊 LLM Audit Dashboard → historical cost, token usage, quality score trends

---

## 🧵 Tech Stack Suggestions

- **LLM APIs**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Claude
- **Logging**: MLflow, LangSmith, OpenInference
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph, FastAPI, Celery
- **Storage**: DBFS, Azure Blob, local/volume
- **Data**: Pydantic, pandas, Delta, DuckDB
- **Eval**: Custom, Guardrails AI, LLM-as-a-judge

## 🏁 Goal

By completing this checklist, you’ll be ready to own and operate production-grade LLM pipelines, with:
- Resilience and traceability
- Accurate, testable prompt behavior
- Low cost and scalable architecture
- Clean observability and auditability
